# Tahoe LTI Processors
Tahoe Customizations for the LTI Consumer XBlock: Additional team and user fields.

## How it Works
This package uses the LTI Consumer XBlock interface to add extra parameters
in addition to the default LTI parameters.

## Usage
Install the pip package:

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/appsembler/tahoe-lti.git
```

Add the following settings to your `server-vars.yml` (or whatever method you configure your Open edX installation):

```yaml
EDXAPP_XBLOCK_SETTINGS:
  lti_consumer:
    parameter_processors:
      - 'tahoe_lti.processors:basic_user_info'
      - 'tahoe_lti.processors:personal_user_info'
      - 'tahoe_lti.processors:cohort_info'
      - 'tahoe_lti.processors:team_info'
```

`Note:` For edX installations prior to `Juniper`, it should be in `json` format

```.json
"XBLOCK_SETTINGS" : {
    "lti_consumer": {
        "parameter_processors": [
            "tahoe_lti.processors:basic_user_info",
            "tahoe_lti.processors:personal_user_info",
            "tahoe_lti.processors:cohort_info",
            "tahoe_lti.processors:team_info"
        ]
    }
}
```

**Legal Notice:** Both ``basic_user_info`` and ``personal_user_info`` sends personal user information to potential 3rd-party LTI providers.
Please make sure that this is reflected on the Privacy Policy of the site.


Restart the Open edX instance and it should be working.

### How to Test?
 - Set the LTI Passports to `test:test:secret` in the course advanced settings.
 - Add the `lti_consumer` to the advanced modules.
 - From the advanced modules create a new LTI module
 - Configure the module like the following:
   * URL: `https://lti.tools/saltire/tp`
   * LTI ID: `test`
   * Set **Send extra parameters** to `true`
 - Check the LTI test and you should see the custom parameters:

### Development Guide
You can use whatever workflow you prefer when developing XBlocks, if you don't have one, here's a suggestion:

 - Install the XBlock SDK. Use the version in [edx/xblock-sdk#142](https://github.com/edx/xblock-sdk/pull/142) or later.
 - All the steps below should be run within the XBlock SDK virtual environment
 - Install the Consumer LTI XBlock.
 - Checkout this repo
 - Install this repo in edit mode `$ pip install -e tahoe-lti`
 - Go to In the XBlock SDK and add a `private.py` settings file with the settings above to enable the processors
 - Run the XBlock SDK and choose the `LTI Consumer XBlock` scenario
